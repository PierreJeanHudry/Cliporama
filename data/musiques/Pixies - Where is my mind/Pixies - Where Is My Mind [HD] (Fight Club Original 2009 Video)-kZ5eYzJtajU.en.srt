1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,120
Stop!

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,400
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
Try this trick and spin it

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,100
Yeah

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,800
Your head will collapse

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,700
But there's nothing in it

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,400
And you'll ask yourself

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,300
Where is my mind?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Where is my mind?

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,600
Wheeere is my mind?...

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,400
Way out..

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,000
In the water
See it swimmin'

13
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,000
I was swimmin'
in the Caribbean

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Animals were hiding
behind the rock

15
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,700
Except the little fish

16
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,140
But they told me, he swears

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
Tryin' to talk to me, coy koi.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,100
Where is my mind?

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
Where is my mind?

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,000
Wheeere is my mind?...

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,240
Way out..

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,000
In the water 
see it swimmin'

23
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,040
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,040
Try this trick and spin it

25
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,300
Yeah

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
Your head will collapse

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,300
If there's nothing in it

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
And you'll ask yourself

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Where is my mind?

30
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,000
Where is my mind?

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,700
Wheeere is my mind?...

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,100
Way out..

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,400
In the water 
see it swimmin'

34
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,800
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,700
Try this trick and spin it

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,540
Yeah

37
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,960
(You met me at a very 
strange time in my life...)
